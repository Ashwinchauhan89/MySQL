# Database

A **database** is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve large amounts of information. They are commonly used in various applications, from websites and business systems to scientific research and mobile apps.

## Key Characteristics

- **Structured Data**: Data is stored in a structured format, often using tables, rows, and columns.
- **Efficient Access**: Databases support quick search, insert, update, and delete operations.
- **Data Integrity**: Rules and constraints ensure accuracy and consistency of data.
- **Security**: Access controls protect data from unauthorized access or modification.

## Types of Databases

- **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: Store data in tables (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
- **NoSQL Databases**: Store unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
- **In-Memory Databases**: Store data in RAM for faster access (e.g., Redis).
- **Cloud Databases**: Hosted on cloud platforms (e.g., Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Firestore).
